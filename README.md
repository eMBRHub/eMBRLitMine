# eMBRLitMine
Literature mining tool that can help associate chemical compounds with microorganism that could be involved in their remediation. Will use statistics(counts) of documents in which the co-occurence exists in a cohort of relevant documents.

To serve eMBRLitMine over the internet we use GraphViz. For the GraphViz web interphase we use the simplified 'webdot.pl' script which enables use of TCL in GraphViz web pages. Written by Stephen North, with a huge assist from John Linderman, this is available from http://graphviz.org/Misc/webdot.pl
